This is a phone virus transmission simulation.

Firstly, To increase the number of phones in the simulation, please press the "up" arrow key. These phones have three
different status, this includes healthy phones, infected phones, and phones going to the repair shop. These are represented
by their own colour. Healthy phones are blue, infected phones are red and phones going to the repair shop are green.

Secondly, press "v" key to randomly assign a virus to a phone. The virus tranmits to other phones within 20 pixels. After
the phone gets infected, the countdown starts of their lifespan from 500 to 0. Once, it reaches 0 it will be removed from
the simulation. Only the repair shop can stop this process of phones being removed. Please note only one phone can enter 
the RepairShop at a time.

Thirdly, observe the results. There is a bar representing each status of the phone. This is a visual aid for the user. 
The progress bar resets every 4 seconds and is only activated if a phone is present in the repairShop.

Have Fun!
